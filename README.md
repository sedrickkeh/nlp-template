# NLP Template

This is a template for NLP projects in PyTorch. The sample task used is [Disaster Classification] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview). Data was split into train/valid/test and stored in `data`.

TODO:
- double check trainer file and logging
- add testing
- tqdm
- wandb integration
- linting/formatting
